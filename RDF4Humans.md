DISCLAIMER: These are my opinions and nothing else, JISC's director's will make the decision on how next to proceed with regard to linkeddata

Let's pretend that JISC were going to do another Programme of projects to work on linkeddata, what might we do this time around to build on the success of the jiscEXPO programme?  What would that new Programme of work look like?

I personally feel they should consider two areas for applying linkeddata to Universities.  I believe the following to areas to be the sweet spot we have discovered in the jiscEXPO programming for using linkeddata

No.1. - Linkeddata as a lingua franca for the Knowledge Structures of Academia.

In the same way that Latin was the language for the Roman elite, so should RDF be the language we use to discuss and agree how we scaffold the vocabularies and knowledge structures of Academic disciplines.  The reason I emphasise it as a "verbal language" rather than a "programming language" is because I think in the first instance it should act as a "human language" to build communities around discussing the knowledge structures by which we hang all our information, and in the second instance used to translate that discussion for machines to do the heavy lifting of the decision.  In short, I believe there to be two forms of RDF:

a.) RDF for Humans: this RDF is how humans can begin the discussion around knowledge structures, the typical example being the discussions we have for vocabularies for information.  For example discussing how we commonly should describe information about: a book, a journal, a dataset, an archive, a student, a researcher, a set of chemical compounds, a geographical map, an experiment, etc.  I'm not suggesting that humans actually speak "RDF" as in verbally saying: "haetch-tee-tee-pee-colon-slash-slash-purl-dot-org-slash-terms-slash-dee-cee" - though at the start of the conversation we may need to express this in some way to dereference which vocabulary we are referencing for a community discussion.  Rather I imagine it as a pseudo RDF language that allows us to debate which terms of most applicable to a given resource.  For example if I were debating a book and an image I might first talk about "MARC 100" being equivalent to "DC CREATOR" and both of us in that discussion would understand we are implying a "SAME AS / SIMILAR" relation between the two, and likewise I might talk about a "VRA ARTIST" for the image as also being "SIMILAR" to "DC CREATOR" - of course this would cause all kind of debate, which is a good thing (especially if we come up with more human examples for how that community debate can happen and produce agreements and results, more on this later).

b.) RDF for Machines (RDF4M): this is the machine version of the language as it is serialised in an actual programming languages be that Java, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, etc.  This is the RDF that most of us will know (and most will abhor to read).  This is where the RDF language is turned pragmatic and leveraged for use so that the machine can take on the decisions of the "RDF4HVD" and start to do the heavy lifting that automation that machines do so well.  I would emphasise this is not necessarily the pure form of RDF you find in triplestores as triples, but rather the RDF that gets hacked to actually work in everyday situations be that in a relational database, a key-value store, a graph store an XML store or even embedded within Web pages via HTML5 or the like.

The reason I feel these two types of RDF need to be separated is so that we can start to experiment with more human communities for discussing linkeddata and its applications in Universities, with the serialisation and pragmatics .  We need more experimentation and effort in making the implicit knowledge structures we use everyday to be made explicit by discussing them with RDF4HVD.

If this were a new programme of work I would suggest that we fund a dozen year long projects to experiment with new forms of discussing and creating vocabularies. This would build on the excellent work by projects in the jiscEXPO programme like: #jiscOpenBib #locah #jiscOpenCite #docsWorksTexts and #sailsProject - where we have started to see new types of human community interaction methods for agreeing vocabularies.

I would hope that of those dozen projects we have a mixed portfolio of projects looking to create knowledge structures such as: a.) subject vocabularies and taxonomies, e.g. terms used in child psychology education or terms for nano particle experiments, b.) organising methods, e.g. how people or resources like books are described and organised, c.) lists of methods for doing actions, e.g. common Academic practices such as referencing or doing an experiment.

Of course the risk in doing a project just focused on the RDF4HVD would be the lack of turning the theoretical discussion into the pragmatic application and so there would need to be a requirement in the project to leverage the RDF4HVD into a real world use of it via RDF4M.

In a project Utopia, the projects would spend 6-8 months discussing the vocabulary and establishing a community for that discussion and then spend the latter 6-8 months building and integrating the vocabulary into pragmatic tools and processes.  Of course in reality I would expect it to go very different with some vocabulary communities off to an early start (because they have joined another vocabulary community and/or projects to run the entire 12 months only discussing and building up the community without actually producing real world examples.  Learning from these different use cases would inform the next programme of work, as it always does :)

So the above is strawman for the first of two programmes of work on linkeddata, the second programme of work would most likely be run at the same time however there is significant reason to seperate the two as the above programme of work is primarily about research, teaching and learning, while this second programme of work would be about administrative data for an institution, i.e. how to make the actual internal University clockwork run better.

No.2 - Linkeddata as an Enterprise Technology for Data Warehousing.
