# Introduction to Project Documentation #
All JISC projects are **required** to complete documentation.  While documentation can be laborious, it is important to view documentation as the way the story of your project can be told to others!  Documentation is there to help spread good practice amongst our community and to help you to effectively plan the work you want to achieve. For the jiscEXPO set of projects we have attempted to scope all documentation so you can directly see the benefits that documentation has for yourself and for the community as a whole.

It is worth noting that jiscEXPO projects are utilising a new and different style of documentation that is lightweight, open and web-worthy.  Overall we hope the following documentation gets you writing stories for one another as a community, rather than just to the JISC Executive.  We hope to achieve this by having every project use a blog as their primary documentation website so that they can update one another on the progress as they make it.  Once you have achieved your final project output we would then encourage you to launch an official website at the end of your project.  Until then, just get as many thoughts, ideas and win/fail posts up as possible.

Please note, the use of a "blog" should not be seen as an informal tool but rather as system that will assure that all the advice and stories produced from a project have a URL (so you can openly share the advice) and within a feed (so we can move the content around so it is more easily read).

Below is a list of documentation you will need to complete so as to fulfil your remit as a JISC funded project.

# Overview of jiscEXPO Project Documentation #
_**There are three sets of documents you are required to complete during the course of your JISCRI project, of which the project blog is the main documentation output:**_

  1. [Description of a Project (DOAP) Form](http://code.google.com/p/jiscexpo/wiki/ProjectDocumentationInstructions#Description_of_a_Project_(DOAP)_Form): A description of all the project contact information and resources.
  1. [Project Blog](http://code.google.com/p/jiscexpo/wiki/ProjectDocumentationInstructions#Project_Blog): The primary website for all ongoing project work.
    * [Project Plan Posts](http://code.google.com/p/jiscexpo/wiki/ProjectDocumentationInstructions#Project_Plan_Posts): 7 posts copy/pasted (and shortened) from your project bid outlining your project plan.
    * [Progress Posts](http://code.google.com/p/jiscexpo/wiki/ProjectDocumentationInstructions#Progress_Posts): a minimum of one post per month should be posted **with appropriate tags**.
    * [Final Product Post](http://code.google.com/p/jiscexpo/wiki/ProjectDocumentationInstructions#Final_Product_Post): this post lists the final output and product delivered by the project.
  1. [Final Project Budget and Sign-Off Form](http://code.google.com/p/jiscexpo/wiki/ProjectDocumentationInstructions#Final_Project_Sign-Off): Your final spend budget and a survey to get your overall impression of what being a JISC project has accomplished for your team and for your institution.

Instructions and templates for these three sets of documentation are detailed below.

**_Please remember all documents you create as part of your project are subject to FOI so best to maintain best practice with regards to transparency and openness throughout your project - and don't forget to display your Creative Commons License on EVERYTHING_**

## Description of a Project (DOAP) Form ##
  1. **[DOAP Form](http://bit.ly/doap-jiscEXPO)** <- please fill out this form within the first fortnight of your project.
    * This form is gathering the key contact details and resources in your project so that JISC can support you as effectively as possible in monitoring your project.
    * For example by having all the project blog feeds we can aggregate them into a central feed so we can more effectively pass on news and developments as they occur to other JISC projects.
    * This form must be kept up to date throughout the duration of the project and should be updated at the following link if any changes occur: http://bit.ly/doapSS-jiscEXPO <-- please bookmark this link now you will need it!

## Project Blog ##
  * So as to make your life easier we are suggesting a series of blog posts be written for the project as it progresses.
  * The posts are intended to disseminate the knowledge of the project in the now, rather than waiting until the end of the project to share your experiences.
  * Please make sure to use the correct tags for each post (including your own project tag) so that our robots can come along and aggregate all posts on various topics into our analytics tools (manyEyes, Google Data, etc).  We are hoping this open data approach helps increase the synchronous-ability in which we communicate with one another.
  * The posts can be as short or as long as you like so long as you keep your fellow projects and Higher Education community audience in mind, e.g. what would you want to read from another project?

### Project Plan Posts ###

To get your project blog started we REQUIRE that you publish your project plan as a series of project blog posts.  This should be an easy task as you should be copying and pasting your project bid into the following categories (please shorten as much as possible so it is easy to read for anyone who might encounter it on the Web).  And remember you can always come back to the various posts and update them via the comments sections when things change (and they will change).

| **Project Plan Posts** | **Description / Example** | **Required Tags** |
|:-----------------------|:--------------------------|:------------------|
| Project Plan Post 1 of 7: Aims, Objectives and Final Output(s) of the project | This post should clearly list the overall aim, the objectives that will support that aim and what outputs will be achieved if the Objectives are achieved. | projectPlan, aim, objectives, outputs, jiscEXPO, inf11, jisc <-- and don't forget your project tag! |
| Project Plan Post 2 of 7 Wider Benefits to Sector & Achievements for Host Institution | JISC projects are often a compromise between benefit to the local institution and the wider University sector.  The best projects are able to find a common middle ground that achieve both.  How are you going to achieve success both for your local institution and the wider community? | projectPlan, institutionalBenefits, communityBenefits, jiscEXPO, inf11, jisc <-- and don't forget your project tag! |
| Project Plan Post 3 of 7: Risk Analysis and Success Plan | This post should attempt to forecast both the risks or hurdles that might arise as the project progresses as well as how the project will manage sucess if its outputs become extremely popular? | projectPlan, riskAnalysis, successPlan, jiscEXPO, inf11, jisc <-- and don't forget your project tag! |
| Project Plan Post 4 of 7: IPR (Creative Commons Use & Open Source Software License) | This post should clearly state what licenses will be applied to all work and outputs throughout the course of the project, most importantly this post can then act as a default link to add to other project web pages so IPR is clearly stated and justified |projectPlan, copyright, IPR, license, jiscEXPO, inf11, jisc <-- and don't forget your project tag! |
| Project Plan Post 5 of 7: Project Team Relationships and End User Engagement. | This post should explain who is on the project team and what responsibilities they have, also information on how engagement with end users should be included. | projectPlan, projectTeam, users, yourUniqueProjectTag, jiscEXPO, inf11, jisc <-- and don't forget your project tag!  |
| Project Plan Post 6 of 7: Projected Timeline, Workplan & Overall Project Methodology | A suggested timeline (e.g. gannt or burndown chart should be listed) along with projected workpackages for the project completion.  Also an overall methodology (e.g. Prince, Agile, etc) for how the project deliverables will be achieved should be stated. | projectPlan, timeline, projectMethodology, jiscEXPO, inf11, jisc <-- and don't forget your project tag!  |
| Project Plan Post 7 of 7: Budget | This initial project budget should be a forecast for future spending along with a justification for why the money should be spent this way, we realise this will change over the course of the project.  Also please take the opportunity to establish where and how the budget will be managed, e.g. will it be a local department account or will it be a central account, will you have your own budget code and who is the person in the budget department you have sat down with to make sure the spending of the money will go smoothly.  The biggest slow down of a project is budget departments questioning payments which can often be solved by establishing a good relationship with your budget department from the start.| projectPlan, budget, yourUniqueProjectTag, jiscEXPO, inf11, jisc <-- and don't forget your project tag! |

### Progress Posts ###

The following topics make up some of the suggested Progress Posts (you can do these posts in the order you see as most pragmatic to your project).  MAKE SURE TO USE REQUIRED TAGS where appropriate.

**We would like you to write a blog post on the following themes during the course of your project, though you are welcome to find variance in the theme as you see fit.  We are not prescriptive here and really want you to write something that people in the community will want to read, i.e. don't write them for JISC alone.
  * You must cover all the topic themes (and use all the tags) below: be that in ten separate posts or in three or four longer posts (though our preference is for early and often where possible).
  * Please do be imaginative and use these posts to broadcast the things you are achieving to the wider sector.**

| **Suggested Progress Post Topics** | **Description / Example** | **Required Tags** |
|:-----------------------------------|:--------------------------|:------------------|
| "Project Evaluation" aka iterative reflection | Undertake a quick iterative evaluation process, aka something that can be done when you are board waiting for public transportation (e.g.[SWOT analysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWOT_analysis)) of your project.  The key is to truly knowing thyself or at least your project. | SWOT, projectEvaluation, jiscEXPO, progressPost, inf11, JISC, <-- and don't forget your project tag! |
| "User participation" aka use cases | What is the core user case(s) you think of when developing the app; how has this story changed as you have engaged with the end user e.g. "we often talk about Sam the part time working student we met while at...".  Bonus points for actually talking about real end-users you are working with (note: you are not the end user!) | userCase, endUser, jiscEXPO, progressPost, inf11, JISC, <-- and don't forget your project tag! |
| "Day-to-day work" aka tools, tips and trick that make you productive | What software tools or productivity methods do you use and how do you use them?  How do they make you more productive and why do you see value in using them?  Any and all tools, methodologies or diagrams showing off the way your project is run from an individual or team perspective are welcome. | methodology, implementation, productivity, progressPosts, jiscEXPO, inf11, JISC, <-- and don't forget your project tag! |
| "Technical standards" aka stuff you reuse | What technologies, frameworks, standards or anything else that makes your life easier (or harder) in your work.  For example: what programming language (or framework, IDE, pattern, etc) do you use and why do you love it, e.g. "why I love Object Relational Mapping in Python and Django" or "why I think SWORD is great but could do this...", please remember to provide links for standards and acronyms, etc. | techStandards, technicalDevelopment, progressPosts, jiscEXPO, inf11, JISC, <-- and don't forget your project tag! |
| "Value Add" aka what shifted your thinking in a new direction | What was the most important thing you discovered that brought value to your project, e.g. what was the deciding factor that made you make a specific decision on a what technology, process or human process you were going to use? |  valueAdd, disruptiveInnovation, progressPosts, jiscEXPO, inf11, JISC, <-- and don't forget your project tag! |
| "Small WIN(s") & "FAIL(s)"**aka advice others could benefit from**|  Announce small wins for the project, e.g. when you finish a coding sprint or when a user has a 'wow your software is cool' moment.  The more of these short "win" posts the better!  Also don't forget to post the FAIL(s) as well: telling people where things went wrong so they don't repeat mistakes is priceless for a thriving community. | WIN or FAIL, progressPosts, jiscEXPO, inf11, JISC, <-- and don't forget your project tag!|

### Final Product Post ###
This post if an advertisement for your final project product and outputs (DEADLINE: one month before the end of the project)
For this post you are required to address each one of the elements within the below template.
  * FinalProductPostTemplate

## Final Project Sign-Off ##
DEADLINE: a fortnight before the end of the project (budgets must be approved and signed of by your JISC Programme Manager so allow time for at least one round of adjustments)
  * 1.) **Final Budget Template** (everyone must fill this out and have it approved by their programme manager prior to being submitted as the final piece of project documentation)
    * **Instructions for filling out the final budget spreadsheet:**
      1. [go to this link and read over the instructions](https://spreadsheets2.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?hl=en_GB&key=ttHfWJPFUuSkblrFjQPMHWg&hl=en_GB#gid=1).
      1. find your project tab at the bottom of the page and fill out data there.
      1. if you need to download a copy of your spreadsheet please go to: File > Download as > Excel
      1. if you download please know you will need to copy and paste the data back into the master spreadsheet maintaining the format of the budget.  Note: the master spreadsheet calculates data based on where the data is located so if data moves from specific column/row/cell the spreadsheeet will be to be recalibrated to do totals.
      * If you would like to request that the budget be redacted from being published online you will need to write out a project blog post outlining which parts of the budget will need to be redacted and why, this post must justify to the wider community and to JISC why your publiclly funded projects should not be openly reported along with what data about the budget you will be making available to the wider community for reuse.  This report does not guarantee that any parts of the budget will be redacted and is subject to JISC's decision.

  * 2.)**Final Sign-off Survey Form** (Your project is not officially closed until this form is completed in full.  The link to this form will be passed to you by your Programme Manager once you have had your final budget approved).
    * This form should be filled out as a team so as to reflect upon the experiences of the projects.  JISC would ask for your honest and forthright opinion in what lessons were learned and how we could improve things for future projects based on your experience.
