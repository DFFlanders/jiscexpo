_NOTE TO PROJECT ON THIS PAGE: This is my informal open notebook page on your project.  I'll do my best to keep it up to date, but this is just my personal notes so it will not be pretty!

# Project Overview #
  * **Full Name of Project**: The Open Citations Project: Publishing life science bibliographic citation data as Open Linked Data
    * **Project Tag**: jiscopencite
  * **Project Descriptions** (how would you describe this project to your neighbour?):
    * **short**: We will publish reference lists from Open Access biomedical journal articles as Linked Open Citation Data at http://opencitations.net
    * **long**: The Open Citations Project is global in scope, designed to change the face of scientific publishing. It aims to make bibliographic citation links as easy to use as Web links, and its goals are four-fold:  (i) To establish http://opencitations.net, a public RDF triplestore for biomedical literature citations. (ii) To harvest the reference lists from many current and recent open access journal articles, starting with those in UK Pubmed Central, those published by the Public Library of Science and Biomed Central, those from other publishers willing for CrossRef to release their data, and articles from other Open Access repositories such as EPrints. (iii) To convert these datasets into RDF, using CiTO, the Citation Typing Ontology (http://purl.org/net/cito/) to encode the citation information. (iv) To publish these citation datasets as Open Linked Data on the Talis Connected Commons Platform under an open data license in both human- and computer-accessible formats. As such, the Open Citation Project seeks to promote citation datasets as first class information objects.  The reference list from each article processed will be published as an individual named graph, with its own individual Digital Object Identifier (DOI) assigned by the relevant publisher via CrossRef or by the British Library on behalf of the DataCite Project.
    * **problem it solves?**: to provide links for individual citations (as opposed to just human-only readable text)
  * **Project Outputs/Products/Deliverables** (what thing are you producing?):
    1. An RDF repository for Linked Open Citation Data at http://opencitations.net.
    1. Standards and methods for publishing Linked Open Citation Data that others can use.
    1. Open citation data from life science journal articles available on the web, for utilization by citation network analysis applications, and for tracking the impact of research grant funding.
