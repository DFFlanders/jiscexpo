# Introduction #
UK and US Linked Data Activities Synthesis Meet-up, Mimas, Manchester. 13th July 2011.

Attendees: Adrian Stevenson (UKOLN/JISCExpo), Jerry Persons (Knowledge Motifs LLC/Stanford), Paul Miller (Cloud of Data), Rob Hawtin (Curtis and Cartwrights)

Aims of the meeting:

- "to get you four together as you represent a level of synthesis and overview for linkeddata"

- "ideally with an opportunity to pass back some common agreed recommendations to JISC (perhaps even to share with Stanford/Melon)"

- "See if there is any joint work to be done across the pond?"

Adrian chaired.

We each briefly talked about what we're doing.

Adrian talked about the Jiscexpo synthesis/program evidence gathering work. [ It was noted by Paul Miller (as has been the case by Liz Lyon, Director UKOLN), that synthesis is a more accurate term than program evidence gathering, as we do indeed synthesise the evidence around the issues, as well as just gather it.

Rob talked about the 'Business Case for Linked Data' report himself and Paul are working on. They aim to produce about 10 recommendations for an internal report to JISC.

Jerry Persons then spoke about his involvement in the CLIR/Stanford Linked Data Workshop (info at http://www.diglib.org/archives/832/ and write up at http://inkdroid.org/journal/2011/07/14/stanford-linked-data-meeting-notes-an-incidental-manifesto/). These activities have been three years in gestation. The workshop was about getting "players to step up and put skin in the game".  Funding was available for 4 or 5 invited players including national libraries to get in.
Question posed: Is OCLC getting more open? They are nervous about CC0 and going with CC-BY according to Jerry. This may be the best likely compromise. There's the intention of having a decent shot at names. VIAF is OK, but it's not open. You can't get a download. There have been some conversations with Getty about their authorities, but only conversations.
The authority file issue may be a main choke point, and the Getty ones come up again and again. Need authority files to be more open. Can't get a download of VIAF, so it's not open in that sense.
French went with proprietary data, but saw the UK activities, and so now trying to get it open.  Jerry thinks they will get LoC on board, and the  Germans willing to play. PM suggested the TEL European library a way to pull the French data in.

We then talked around Linked Data issues framed around the themes at https://docs.google.com/present/edit?id=0AfE1-OmwladLZGdieGpyN3hfNTZnZGdrNDhnag&hl=en_US&authkey=CP2IockG

Dirty Data - It was questioned whether this is more of problem in this sector.
Linkeddata.org is this useful?  Perhaps it's not community enough.
Should W3C do more here to help?
 Is there a role for JISC / CETIS role to gather materials for the HE sector?
Lack of tools. Some of the tools look compelling, but the whole thing doesn't hang together that well.
 JISC could recommend half a dozen browsers and triple stores and keep their eye on them.

Issue of vocabs. What's best to use and what's out. Sindice really useful for seeing what's being used and the what level.
 Data.ac.uk could be a repository of last resort. This would be better than trying to provide a central resource.
 Maybe LOCKKS could address vocab sustainability -  they suck up all the vocabs and ontologies.

 Do the tools need to be signposted? - role for UKOLN? Or if you google, do you find what you need anyway?

 Encourage community norms for licensing.
 Encourage community norms for provenance and attribution.
JP: You can make a choice using a national library data set and make a statement.

Data version control/sustainability. JP: There's often an 'impedance mismatch' between small changes in the source data and then getting it converted to RDF. All the names matching you've done gets blown out of the water, and you may have to do it all again.

Scalability not considered to be a real problem. This will get fixed in time. It's already possible to get optimised solutions for triple stores.
Nevertheless, if RDFa increases page size by 5-30%, that's a big deal for Amazon.

Provenance - It's questionable whether this is a real worry or not.

Is JISC sustainable enough to host .ac.uk? :) Data first, schema last - need to avoid to top down ontologies. CYC model. This is a Freebase mantra - do the organisation afterwards, bottom up not top down. It's an iterative process.

Engagement - Noted that McKenzie Smith got very little interest in Linked Data when speaking at CNI event. The message not getting through.

 Getting into the areas of data high with high student visibility is where to go. Although Colleges may not want to publicise some of the negative figures. So it's worth looking at what data is available at the student level, and what the potential is for LD benefits here.

Working together in the future? - Yes this would be great, but would require funding.
