Dr. X is working diligently in her office, working on her latest publications which she is hoping will elevate her portfolio of research to the status of tenure.  A knock at the door, and Dr. X answers.  It is the librarian standing at the door. Dr. X, smiles and welcomes a Librarian, called Mr. Undewey...

Dr. X: Welcome Mr. Undewey, glad to see you are still making your regular visits to us working in the trenches”.

Undewey: “The enjoyment is all mine -believe it or not- I love getting the latest ideas out of you and your colleagues brains and then mapping them to the various vocabularies we’ve just begun to evolve these past five years... afterall what else were we librarians ever intended to do?”

Dr X: “ah, I can remember a time when librarians didn’t care about how are ideas were changing, but only how they could force our evolving ideas into the static vocabularies they held as sacrosanct”.

Undewey: “those days are long gone, archived as part of ‘library historical studies’ -  you should see the exciting work that is taking place in library schools these days...  now that the all powerful 'link' is seen as the primary tool of all librarians”.

Dr. X: “I’m glad to hear it.  The links you have created for me have changed the way I think about my work”

Undewey: “Shall we start in on mapping your latest set of ideas?”.

Dr. X: “yes please”

Undewey: “Just as a reminder, I’d like to show you the last four vocabulary indexes we generated for your research...”

Dr. X: “... ah excellent, I’ve put the last set you printed up on my wall, the 'spider graph diagrams' are really helpful in helping me think around the space of my personal research...”

Undewey: “That’s great. Well, here are the latest versions... as you recall the first mapping is of you at the centre with linked mappings of your collaborators with strong links in bold for those whom you’ve worked with over the past two,  five and ten years; the second map is a list of subject discipline keywords that I text-mined out of your publications and then cross referenced against the vocabulary terms of your fellow colleagues, again with links between nodes bolded where there is a strong co-relation; the third, is a vocabulary of the types of experiments and methods (activities) you’ve used in doing your research which are then associated per keyword to your research; and, the fourth is a vocabulary of your ideas, colleagues and experiments mapped to geospatial maps and temporal timelines, which all cross reference against your personal set of keywords.

Dr. X: “I’m amazed every time you generate these sets of maps for me, and it always amazes me how associating my research, lab data and experimental blog entries generates so much more readership for me from other disciplines.

Undewey: “ah, it is all in the capabilities of 'the graph' and being able to browse beyond just mere search keywords”

Dr. X: You often talk about this graph, but alas my research area is not as up to speed with mathematics as librarianship.  Could you explain what “the graph” is to you in simple terms?

Undewey: Well, long before Google most people were reliant upon the power of serendipity searching, otherwise known as "browsing", which is something the first version of the web was not able to support...TBC

A vision statement for identifier sets:  the librarian profession has been stuck in a world of static vocabularies and canonical taxonomies for centuries; the Web gives us the capability to step forward from this dark age of rigid hierarchy and into a world of information graphs that dynamically come together to form new Venn graphs available within the click of a button.
