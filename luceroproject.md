# Project Overview #
  * **Full Name of Project**: LUCERO – Linking University Content for Education and Research Online
    * **Project Tag**: luceroproject
  * **Project Descriptions**:
    * **short**: LUCERO will create the procedures to include the exposure of linked educational, research and administrative data in the university's practices.
    * **long**: Working with groups of learners, researchers and administrative practitioners based at the Open University, LUCERO will scope, prototype, pilot and evaluate reusable, cost-effective solutions relying on the 'linked data' principles and technologies for exposing and connecting educational and research content. Core sets of resources considered within LUCERO are institutional repositories of research and educational material, including collaborations with the Faculty of Arts to scope, pilot, prototype and evaluate specific content exposure and linked data requirements of researchers working within the Arts and Arts History domains, providing experience on the exposure and connection of research data outputs, and demonstrating their concrete benefits. On the basis of such concrete experience, the project will aim to document business process changes required to achieve successful integrated institutional approaches to exposing educational, research and central administrative content as linked data.
  * **Project Outputs/Products/Deliverables** (what thing are you producing?):
    1. A "Toolkit ABout Linked Open Institutional Data" (TABLOID). TABLOID is an evolving toolkit made of code, documentation and examples in various places, and trying to address the people with various roles involved in the deployment of linked data: from managers who want to quickly understand the benefits, to developers who are expected to work with it, develop applications and integrate it into their technical workflow.
    1. technical infrastructure via data.open.ac.uk to facilitate the creation, exposure and use of linked data in a HE/FE organisation
    1. experience reports and guidelines on the processes necessary to integrate linked data in the Univeristy’s practices and workflows
    1. demonstrators of the benefits of exposing educational and research data as linked data through applications improving access to such data in the domain of Arts.

# Review of Final Product #
http://lucero-project.info/lb/2011/07/final-product-post-tabloid/
  * Final Project Product: A Toolkit (aka Cookbook) for How Universities and Colleges can Manage, Develop and Support their Institutional Data as Linked Data.
  * People who can use the Final Product: IT Managers, Developers, and Data Managers at Universities and Colleges
  * Rating from Review Panel of Final Product: 3 of 5 Stars

## Quotes from Review Panel on the Value of the Final Product ##
  * "This project was new to me and I was very pleased to see that it was both funded and expertly carried out. The final project post points to a number of rich and informative posts that contextualized the use of Linked Data within the HE sector, and offer some useful examples of the benefits of the LD approach. Having read the final project post, as well as the 'tabloid page' and the 'what is linked data?' page and a number of other posts, I am keen to start a serious discussion around the advocacy of Linked Data at our institution and feel like the toolkit provides good support for doing so. I was also pleased to see the spin-off 'Linked Universities Portal', which promises to be a useful resource (although may be deprecated in favour of offering such information on data.ac.uk?)"
  * "One aspect that might be improved upon is guidance on achieving overall institutional buy-in. The 'What is Linked Data?' page is a very good overview, but as the project makes clear, many of the problems that Linked Data presents relate to obtaining the data in the first place (i.e. they are people/organisational problems, not technical). It would be useful if a section of the website addressed this more clearly, perhaps offering an FAQ for Registrars, an FAQ for ICT Managers, an FAQ for Developers, an FAQ for IP Managers, etc. - much of this is addressed by the project website, but could be more usefully presented, because as it stands, the project provides a compelling case for going down the LD route, but could improve on offering support to enthusiasts who are hitting institutional brick walls."
  * "Tabloid proposes a useful framework (multi-tiered matrix) of components and activities aimed at providing managers, those who create/provision data, and technology types with a guide to the whys, whats / hows, plus potential benefits of applying linked data to their environs and needs.  The web site provides a valuable mixture of models for analysis of workflows and data transformation coupled with access to experience gained over the last several months.  Also included are examples of applications that help illustrate the creation, use, and benefits of various flavors of linked data."
  * "Clear product strategy and selective in terms of the target audience. Comprehensive coverage of introductory resources for developers and managers, although not for end-users."
  * "As with each Linked Data project, the most interesting and re-useable outcome of Lucero is the data itself. I can already see many interesting links with other datasets, even beyond the ones the team has already linked into."

## How this Final Product Might be Further Developed ##
  * "As stated above, a more clearly defined set of FAQs aimed at managers, a set of key re-usable slides - summary info (extracted from the longer pages/posts) which clearly points to the value that Linked Data brings to the running of the institution. Did the OU create a formal business case in order to embark on LD? If so, this should contain much of the information that other institutions would benefit from. Please share it."
  * "The 'matrix graphic' raises great expectations. I wanted to click “here” (e.g., Vocabularies and Ontologies) and find information about schema in general as well as recommendations for vocabularies that would be useful in one or another setting in Open University environs.  Understanding full well the magnitude of the effort required to populate the graphic doesn’t lessen the value of having documentation, reference implementations, and code examples available in the well ordered form hinted at in the Tabloid matrix.  Too, one wonders if the OU crew has a sense of how much use is being made of their work at other academic institutions.  Could, for example, work with a few well chosen colleagues increase the density of information and examples that populate the matrix while improving the useability of resources by rounding off any OU-only edges and corners?"
  * "Despite omitting end users as the target audience, the project developed demonstrators and tools that may entail new and enhance user experience. For example, the wayOU app attempted to source and connect use (e.g. "check-in") context and building data. These tools could be developed further so that they could be useful to the end users. The toolkit may also be useful as learning resources for students, researchers and courses related to linked data."
  * Perhaps the toolkit as a whole could have been better broken into a few different products, to be fair. The reasons for collating it into one product is clear, but it does make for a slightly disparate experience."
