# Programme Synthesis Activity Overview #
This programme activity is part of the overall evaluation and communication strategy for telling the world about the jiscEXPO projects and what they have achieved.

People Involved:
  * Programme Manager (PM)
  * Synthesis Liaison (SL)
  * Senior Managers (SM) and their Teams (SMTs)
  * Significant sector stakeholders

The aim of this "synthesis" work is to produce two synthesis artefacts (i.e. reports for specific audiences: a.) an evaluation artefact for Senior Management that will help inform where further money should be dedicated and cut, and b.) a dissemination artefact that can be delivered to significant sector stakeholders both in the UK and Abroad that will inform them of the changes that have occurred and why they should join in on these changes.

Process:
  1. Baseline status of sector established via Project Plan posts and Site Visit
    * PM reads over Project Plan (see [ProjectDocumentationInstructions](ProjectDocumentationInstructions.md)) and takes notes from the project Site Vist (see [SiteVisitAgenda](SiteVisitAgenda.md)).
    * PM produces baseline definition document <--? is this the strand report for NJ?
  1. ChangeLog is daily created by SL reading over project posts and noting down themes as they emerge.
    * SL writes a 'Emergent patterns' synthesis post every fortnight  <- PM delivers reports to jiscEXPO projects and SMs.
    * SL comments on each project blog post to let project know it has been read, also cross-pollinating blog posts by providing cross-links to other blogs.
  1. At end of programme, change log along with posts are reviewed by PM and SL to decide what communication/evaluation techniques to use.
    * SL supports PM in commissioning a evaluation/communications consultant to produce report/publication for specified audiences.
