  * **Project Descriptions** (how would you describe this project to your neighbour?):
    * **short**: Creating and re-using a linked data historic gazetteer through text mining.
    * **long**: Text mining the English Place Name Survey to produce a Linked Data historic gazetteer for areas of England, which can then be used to improve the quality of georeferencing other archives. The gazetteer will be linked to other placename sources on the Linked Data web via geonames.org and linkedgeodata.org. Intensive user engagement with archive projects that can benefit from the open data gazetteer and open source text mining tools.
    * **problem it solves?**: researchers will no longer have to...???
  * **Project Outputs/Products/Deliverables** (what thing are you producing?):
    1. Open source tools for text mining archives
    1. Linked open data gazetteer, searchable through JISC's Unlock service.
