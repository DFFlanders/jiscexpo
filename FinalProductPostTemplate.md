# Final Product Post #

This post if an advertisement for your final reusable prototype / product (NOT an advertisement for your entire project, just the most reusable component of the project).  Below are the subsections you MUST address as part of this post, however we welcome creative advertising endeavours to make your product / prototype interesting to its human readers.

Please title this post as "Final Product Post: [name of prototype / product](insert.md)".  For this post you are required to address each one of the subsections '§' within the below template.

You are welcome to break this post up into multiple posts, but please state that clearly at the top of each post and provide links so the marker's will be able to follow the links with ease (it is your own fault if they do not see everything intended for them).

## Process for submitting final progress post ##
Please submit the link to your final progress post in the DoaP form, there is a column to enter this URL.

Also please make sure your [DoaP details are filled in fully](https://spreadsheets0.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?hl=en_US&key=t-fYaL24VJeakA5ZgeCNJpA&hl=en_US#gid=7), as this will be the final descriptive record published on behalf of the project by JISC on all of its systems about your project.

## Subsections you MUST address in your final post include ##

§ Title of Primary Project Output: what is the thing you have produced that another institution would want to pick up and reuse. Note: try and have a "catchy" name for the product, not a clever acronym... think advertising, e.g. "iPhone by Apple"

§ The type of user this product is for: What kinds of people will actually want to reuse this product? Do you have a picture of this type of person or a description?

§ A visual screenshots or diagram of the prototype/product you have produced: Please provide a series of screenshots or diagram that will quickly explain the point and process of your prototype to the end user. How will the end user interact and use the thing you have created, what should they do with it, provide an example for use.  Annotation on screenshots welcome e.g. step-by-step walk-through.

§ Description of prototype/product (why use this thing, for what benefit?): Please write this description for the end user so they can easily understand what the prototype is about and how to use it, please be brief and to the point (think 'Argos Catalogue'-like description).

§ Link to working prototype/product: This HTTP link should point directly to a working prototype in which the end user can interact, if a working prototype is not available then please provide a screencast or series of screenshots demonstrating end user functionality, this screencast should NOT exceed 5 minutes. Please note: working prototypes are preferred even if just 'rough and ready', please do not send powerpoints or other non-web-based documents, they will not be accepted. This prototype must be maintained for one year after the date of the official project sign-off.

§ Table of Contents to Project Blog (up to this point): To draw a line in the sand you should retrospectively look back over your project blog posts and categorise them into a Table of Contents, drawing out emerging themes and commenting on why these posts were written.  Provide a table of contents but with a narrative explaining why posts were written and what were the most valuable posts.  This is the context for your above product and should support why this product should be reused.

§ Complete the jiscEXPO DoaP Spreadsheet and copy and paste it into this final blog post.  Please make sure to reformat your DoaP project info into a human readable form so it is easy to read **for humans**.  The DoaP on your project should include the following (in whatever order is most desirable for human reading):

Link to step-by-step instructional documentation for reusing your prototype.

Link to code repository for where any and all code / data was published.

Link to technical instructional documentation like PyDOC, javaDoc or some other inline code comment guidance for how to interpret the code that has been written.

Link and icon to license used for code, e.g. GPL3 or Apache2

Link and icon to license used for data, e.g. OPDL or CC-zero

Link and icon to license used for content, e.g. your blog's Creative Commons license.

Start and end dates of project.

Total amount of grant money awarded to project.

Links to Project Team Members. <-- Please also take this opportunity to make sure the "/about" page on your blog accurately represents your current team members, including, their emails and **pictures**.

PIMS URL to project.
