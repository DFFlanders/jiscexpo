# Project Overview #
  * **Full Name of Project**: SAILS: Shipping Archives and Integrated Logbooks of Ships: Linking WW1 Naval Records
    * **Project Tag**: sailsproject
  * **Project Descriptions** (how would you describe this project to your neighbour?):
    * **short**: SAILS will expose and link structured data from WW1 Royal Navy Ship’s logs and Service Records to ‘put sailors back in their ships'
    * **long**: The core of this project is a digital collection of ship’s logs from 1914-1918. Digitized by the Met Office ACRE initiative, their climatological data has been extracted to generate a series of historic weather datasets and visualisations. However, these records also have great value to the social and military history community as they include detailed information about the movement of ships, and about ship’s personnel. They have even greater value if linked to records and source materials from other collections, such as the Royal Navy Service Records in The National Archives. Linking the Service Records to the Logbooks will, effectively, ‘put sailors back in their ships’. SAILS will expose and link the data in the ships logs with data in the Service Records. Based on this, we will develop a methodology for structuring and linking data from disparate sources in order to enhance data available to researchers. Our methodology will be based around specific research questions related to WW1 naval history. We will put the linked materials online as a resource and demonstration of the method used. SAIL will have enormous value for researchers of WW1, and provide an important demonstration of linking and exposing structured data for interdisciplinary research.
    * **problem it solves?**: <it is important you add a real use case here for the end user, as this will be the thing that you will use to sell this project to people outside your organisation>
  * **Project Outputs/Products/Deliverables** (what thing are you producing?):
    1. A collection of resources available on the Web as structured and linked data, to benefit teaching, research and knowledge transfer.                    A   # A prototype with instructional step-by-step demonstrations and documentation of our approach, illustrating how our approach can be applied to other collections and projects.
    1. Reporting on the opportunities and barriers encountered by the project, documenting them, and making recommendations for their amelioration based on our experience.
