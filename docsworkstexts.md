It will link these to item-level records for the works and documents and to books and articles dealing with specific text segments and manuscripts. These records will be made available over the web for harvesting by RDF federators.  The project will create and document a public access demonstrator, showing how a dynamic interface can be built on the harvested RDF records. A public report will outline the lessons learnt from this work.
