_NOTE TO PROJECT ON THIS PAGE: This is my informal open notebook page on your project.  I'll do my best to keep it up to date, but this is just my personal notes so it will not be pretty!

# Project Overview #
  * **Full Name of Project**: Open Bibliography
    * **Project Tag**: jiscopenbib
  * **Project Descriptions** (how would you describe this project to your neighbour?):
    * **short**: Open Bibliography Project - exposing bibliographic information as Linked Open Data
    * **long**: The Open Bibliography Project will deliver a substantial corpus of bibliographic metadata as Linked Open Data, using existing semantic web tools, standards (RDF, SPARQL), linked data patterns and accepted Open ontologies (FoaF, Bibo, DC, FRBR, etc). The data will be from two sources: traditional library catalogues (Cambridge University Library and the British Library) and ToCs from a scientific publisher, the IUCr. None of the material is currently available as LOD. Key strategies are (i) transformation of current publishers' model to create Open Bibliography as part of their future business, and (ii) the immediate and continuing engagement of the scholarly community. Deliverables include a maintained and growing bibliography on the IUCr site and engagements with other like-minded publishers such as PLoS.
    * **problem this solves for what end user?**: the researcher will...???  the librarian won't have to...???
  * **Project Outputs/Products/Deliverables** (what thing are you producing?):
    1. A system for storing bibliographic information in Linked Open Data format (RDF)
    1. A set of bibliographic records from the British Library and Cambridge University Library
    1. Engagement with other publishers interested in Linked Open Data
