# JISC’s Digital Infrastructure Team and Linked Data #

Until 2010, JISC had a long-standing, though intermittent, interest in and engagement with the semantic web, represented for example in a 2005 TechWatch  report.  The consensus has been, until recently, that technologies to support the semantic web vision were lagging behind the promise of that vision, and that take-up was therefore slow.  Subsequently, Tim Berners Lee released the design principles for “linked data”  and, more recently still, there were signs of change, with a 2009 report  identifying significant opportunities, specifically for teaching and learning, in the alignment of semantic technologies with “Web 2.0” tools and services.  There were also changes in the policy context, with the emergence of data.gov.uk (matching similar developments in the US).  In this context, JISC commissioned a ‘horizon scan’ report  which set out an agenda for exploration, and informed the launch of a major programme in 2010 (“jiscEXPO”) which aimed to explore the potential of linked / semantic data in a range of scenarios, from research, teaching and administration.  In parallel with this, projects in other JISC programmes began more readily to use linked data technologies, in particular the eContent and Research Data Management programmes.
The potential of sharing high quality, persistent, trusted, interoperable linked data is clear.  A large range of valuable services could be built on such data, supporting all aspects of the mission of universities and colleges.  However, the constraints in achieving this, in terms of time, skills, legal constraints, data quality and provenance issues, etc, have also been clear for some time.  It is possible to view the jiscEXPO programme as an experiment, to identify under what conditions the linked data approach is worthwhile, and what next steps might increase its cost/benefits.

Two activities have been undertaken to generate answers to these questions.  The first is a synthesis activity led by UKOLN, which is analysing reports (eg thematic blog posts) from the projects and will present the lessons in a programme summary.  This is work in progress, but the main lessons seem to come under the following headings:

  * Data/Dirty Data/Alignment (different naming conventions present challenges, and it may be better to map to established ontologies later)
  * Data Modelling (the expertise needed to model data well is rare, and there are tensions between different perceptions of the detail needed in data models)
  * Data Provenance (there seems no easy way to avoid attribution stacking, and recommended practice seems to be to use CC-0, but make general attributions on the host website)
  * Data Version Control (there are significant challenges in keeping datasets synchronised / reconciled, and a suggestion that quads , rather than triples, might help)
  * Data Ownership (who owns and takes responsibility for data quality?)
  * URI Patterns (there is no consensus on the value of URI patterns, or if there is value, on what patterns to adopt)
  * Skills and Training Gap (there are few useful demonstrators and exemplars to help those developing linked data resources)
  * Scalability (there are recognised performance issues with RDF, and RDFa potential adds considerably to html page size.  This increases massively if attribution and provenance information is included.  A Sparql cache might help.)
  * Sustainability (the challenges of keeping data current, and maintaining its relationships with other data, do not go away.  There is a need for lower cost ways to publish linked data)
  * Licensing (license incompatibilities are a real barrier to reuse, eg MusicBrainz, but some business models may depend on specific licenses)
  * "Data First, Schema Last" (the argument that the important point is to make the data available; make it interoperable later)
  * Administrative Data (there seem to be real opportunities to exploit administrative data, and student / developers seem keen to do so)
  * New Ontology Creation (it is not clear who does this or how it is done)

A second activity was designed to collect evidence on the business case for universities and colleges to use a linked data approach.  The final report from this study is available .  It concluded that linked data technologies are still maturing, which hinders development of best-practice advice and obscures evidence of the benefits.  Nevertheless, it is possible to make a provisional argument that linked data has value in both open and closed environments but that perhaps near term benefits were more likely in closed, curated environments within the institution (this is well-demonstrated by the Lucero and Southampton Open Data Service Projects).  The JISC work has contributed in a number of ways, including expanding and embedding a community of linked data literate people.  However, JISC work in the future should be designed to ensure that evidence of the benefits of linked data is collected by projects as a matter of course.   The full set of recommendations is as follows:

  * Recommendation 1: JISC should develop its policy on linked data.
  * Recommendation 2: JISC should be absolutely clear about the distinction between linked data as an approach and as a set of technologies, and about the terms open data, linked data, linked open data, and closed (or enterprise) linked data.
  * Recommendation 3: JISC should work with stakeholders (which may include HESA, UCAS, and the Research Councils) to establish points of trust in certain common data/information sets in machine readable form.
  * Recommendation 4: JISC should continue to gather information from future projects, and the projects it has established, on the business benefits being realised and Total Cost of Ownership of linked data solutions.
  * Recommendation 5: JISC should establish if, how, and by whom a data.ac.uk site would be used and consider if and how to create one.
  * Recommendation 6: In continuing to support good data management in HE, JISC should investigate and consider if the role of ‘data architect’ is worthy of promotion.
  * Recommendation 7: JISC should ensure that current and future data-handling advice to HEIs takes account of linked data.
  * Recommendation 8: JISC should encourage that appropriate projects consider linked data as a possible solution.
  * Recommendation 9: JISC should focus investment on projects that use linked data as an enabling technology rather than those that rely heavily on semantic tool development.

These recommendations, and the challenges identified in the jiscEXPO programme synthesis, will inform the next phase of work.  In particular, there are two areas of work which are actively being discussed:

1.) Close Enterprise Linkeddata (the new "data warehousing")

2.) Vocabulary creation via reuse.
