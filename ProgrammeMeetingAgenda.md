## Agenda ##
This agenda is DRAFT and therefore subject to change.

### Monday 11th of July ###
This first day will be focused on talking about and introducing your final project products along with the context in which they exist.

  * 9.30am - Start Tea/Coffee
  * 10am - Welcome, housekeeping and orientation by David F. Flanders and Adrian Stevenson.

  * Noon - Project/product introductions: each project will have 3 minutes to introduce their user and the product they have created for use by that user.  Nothing formal, just stand up where you are sitting (no slides please) and just introduce your "user" and an "elevator pitch" for what product you have produced via your project.
    * a list of projects that I have down who are attending (please let me know if you are not listed): #[jiscopenbib](jiscopenbib.md) by Peter, #[locah](locah.md) by Adrian, #[luceroproject](luceroproject.md) by Owen, #[linkedbrainz](linkedbrainz.md) by Simon, #[jiscopencite](jiscopencite.md) by David, #[chaliced](chaliced.md) by Stuart, #[fishdlish](fishdlish.md) by Bijan, #data.southampton by Chris, #lncneu by Joss, #[musicnet](musicnet.md) by Joe, #[docsworkstexts](docsworkstexts.md) by Zeth, #[sailsproject](sailsproject.md) by Richard, #[mimasld](mimasld.md) by Ross, #[ldfocus](ldfocus.md) by Ian, #ezid by John, #acrid product by Arif, #fish.link by Christian, #spqr by Stuart, #webtracks by Shirley, #solreyes by Richard
  * 2pm - Project 'show & tell' (part 1) - These sessions will be run in the style of an "unconference" whereby participants are urged to use the "rule of two feet" by wondering around the room to experience each of the different projects and their products.  Projects should have their working prototype up and ready to show and should have some key points to talk about as participants join and leave the groups ad hoc.  = if you are not participating or engaging in the group's conversation use your two feet and walk to another group where you can engage.

If you can't find much, make some recommendations to JISC on what you do think should be done.

    * Reflect back on the event, and discuss what ideas inspired you and what were the ideas in which you disagreed?
    * Discuss who were interesting people you met for the first time, whom might you get in contact with again?
    * Discuss what you thought and felt about the review panel, was it helpful, provoking, scary, honest, etc.?

    * Discuss what were the best logistical parts of the event, what would you repeat again?
    * Please, don't forget to "post" these notes on the scribe's project blog.
  * 4.30pm - Thank you all, and safe travels... :)

#### Review Panel ####
Review Panel Process: a.) The review panellists will have read over each of the 'final product posts' and submitted a paragraph of text summarising their viewpoints regarding their perceived "reusability" of the product; b.) On the day the entire panel will discuss each project's product and come to agreement on two or three recommendations per project product; c.) Once the panel has agreed their recommendation points the project will be called into the review panel and a panel member will feedback points to the project team members; projects will then have a chance to respond and have any points minuted as part of the recommendation notes; and, d.) JISC will process the recommendations internally and not publish them.  Project may have a copy of the notes upon request.
