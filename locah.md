# Project Overview #
  * **Full Name of Project**: Linked Open Copac Archives Hub
    * **Project Tag**: locah
  * **Project Descriptions**:
    * **short**: going to make data from Copac and the Archives Hub available as Linked Data.
    * **long**: The Archives Hub and Copac national services provide a wealth of rich inter- disciplinary information that we will expose as Linked Data. We will be working with partners who are leaders in their fields: OCLC, Talis and Eduserv. We will be investigating the creation of links between the Hub, Copac and other data sources including DBPedia, data.gov.uk and the BBC, as well as links with OCLC for name authorities and with the Library of Congress for subject headings. This project will put archival and bibliographic data at the heart of the Linked Data Web, making new links between diverse content sources, enabling the free and flexible exploration of data and enabling researchers to make new connections between subjects, people, organisations and places to reveal more about our history and society. http://blogs.ukoln.ac.uk/locah/
  * **Project Outputs/Products/Deliverables** (what thing are you producing?):
    1. Output of structured Linked Data for the Archives Hub and Copac services
    1. a prototype demonstrator

# Review of Final Product #
http://blogs.ukoln.ac.uk/locah/2011/07/01/final-product-post-ead2rdf/
  * **Final Project Product**: An Extensible Stylesheet (XSLT) to Transform Standard Archives Data (EAD) into Linked Data
  * **People who can use the Final Product**: Developers and/or Archive Managers
  * **Rating from Review Panel of Final Product**: 3 of 5 Stars

## Comments from Review Panel ##
  * "Having a truly re-usable resource like the stylesheet is great way to allow others to transform data into linked data format.   The project blog is also a great archive around the decision making processes the team went through, which I think again is really useful reference material for people (developers) wanted to find out more about the processes around converting data."
  * The timelines are a great "in" to the power of link data... For the non-technical user, they start to make sense of the overall approach and the possibilities of taking a linked data approach."
  * The stylesheet itself is useful to other developers as it offers a structured overview of the way data is organised on http://data.archiveshub.ac.uk/ However, the stylesheet's main use is to enable the service at http://data.archiveshub.ac.uk/ It also provides a SPARQL endpoint for developers and a prototype visualisation application for end-users has been developed, too. These outputs demonstrate that much has been achieved by the project that has real-world value to different users. My main frustration is that the dataset made available is quite limited and it would have been good to see more examples of how this product could be used by the Archives Hub, although further development may have been out of scope for this project. This project has produced more than a 'proof of concept' and needs to ensure that the outcomes of the project are further developed into a fully operational service to users."
  * "The stylesheet is a small self-contained product that could clearly be used by many to transform their existing archives and records into Linked Data, if they're able to export it in an EAD (Encoded Archival Description) form. For developers working in LAM (Libraries, Museums and Archives) sector it looks like a simple, useful tool with the timeline providing instant-gratification view of the data."

## Comments for How this Product Could be Developed Further ##
  * "Pretty much does what it says on the tin, for now.  I think it is (rightly) targeted at a specific set of users who will have a certain level of technical knowledge, so not sure if there is that much just now that would enhance take up greatly at this stage. Not sure a presentation/screencast of a data transformation would be that useful:-) - but then again it might to make it easy to understand?"
  * "From a more general usability PoV, I think it really needs more work to develop the visualisations and adding other data sets. That might help to get buy in from less technical managers or potential partners in terms of developing and building new resources based on various data sources and indeed spending time transforming EAD collections."
  * "To make this product more 'usable', it simply needs more data and more applications built on the data, both of which are probably beyond the scope of this initial project."
  * "As someone with out special expertise in this domain I would have benefited from a more patient explanation of the aims and benefits of the product. It's not spelled out anywhere what EAD stands for, or how widely supported it is as a sector standard. I would like to have seen a bit more practical detail on how others could pick up the product and immediately use it with their archive systems."
  * "RDF/XML is not necessarily the best output format, as it is very verbose and can be difficult to work with.  Perhaps other RDF formats, maybe RDFa or even one of the RDF JSON formats (although it's not clear to me what the exact use case is, so I'm not sure what the optiumum output format would be)"
