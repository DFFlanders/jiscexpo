# Why does JISC require an analytics engine on all project web sites #

First off we do not collect analytics to watch over individual projects.  Rather we are looking for trends across all the projects.

Some of the types of trends we are looking for:
  * Total number of unique visitors across
  * Most popular blog post

You should look to collect

# Which analytics engine should I use? #

There are two "freely" available analytics engines, both of which can meet the requirements for JISC in collecting analytics:

  * Google Analytics: Currently the dominant analytics engine on the market and as with all google software it is hosted in the cloud on your behalf.
  * Piwik (Open Source PHP): You will need to host this software yourself however it has a greater diversity of reporting options.
