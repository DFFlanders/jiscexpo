# Project Overview #
  * **Full Name of Project**: fishdelish
    * **Project Tag**: fishdlish <- no "e"
  * **Project Descriptions** (how would you describe this project to your neighbour?):
    * **short**: The FishDelish project will convert the FishBase species database to linked data and demo how to exploit it on the web.
    * **long**: FishBase is an important species-specific collection that receives 400M hits pa. We propose exposing significant parts of FishBase as Linked Data (LD) via a SPARQL endpoint, standard LD browsers, and our own user agent, FishExhibit.  Besided ‘standard’ mashups provided by FishExhibit, we propose novel techniques to easily expose, via a self-publishing mechanism, individuals’ and organisations’ field observations and specimen holdings together with FishBase-derived data. We will use the project to start to develop an educational demonstrator where students can (instead of using an Access database in the current FishBase) use SNORQL and Google Spreadsheets integrated live with the learning materials and LD sources.
    * **problem it solves?**:
  * **Project Outputs/Products/Deliverables** (what thing are you producing?):
    1. Species pages based off current Fishbase data
    1. SPARQL endpoint for the Fishbase data converted to LD
    1. Self publication mechanism
    1. Live SPARQL tutorial mechanism
