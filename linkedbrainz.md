# Project Overview #
  * **Full Name of Project**: Linking Music Metadata
    * **Project Tag**: linkedbrainz
  * **Project Descriptions** (how would you describe this project to your neighbour?):
    * **short**: Publish the MusicBrainz metadatabase as Linked Data with tutorial materials for music and music informatics users
    * **long**: MusicBrainz provides crowd-sourced metadata about musical recordings in what is perhaps the cleanest and most comprehensive music metadata repository on the Web. The aim of this project is to expose the MusicBrainz database, which describes over 9 million musical recordings, on the semantic web as linked data,and link it to other music metadata such as provided by DBpedia and the BBC.  Research issues concern the scalability, sustainability and provenance of the database. Uptake of this work will be encouraged via tutorial materials and  workshops for the academic music and music informatics communities.
    * **problem it solves?**: Students will no longer have to...???
  * **Project Outputs/Products/Deliverables** (what thing are you producing?):
    1. Linked Data RDF served directly from MusicBrainz URIs
    1. A SPARQL endpoint providing access to MusicBrainz' complete metadatabase
    1. Tutorial materials introducing academics in music or music informatics to the semantic web
    1. Tutorial materials demonstrating use of project outputs via sample SPARQL queries and describing how the structured data can be queried and accessed by third party tools and services
