# Project Overview #
  * **Full Name of Project**: musicnet
    * **Project Tag**: musicnet
  * **Project Descriptions** (how would you describe this project to your neighbour?):
    * **short**: Creating canonical URI's for classical musical composers
    * **long**: In this project, we propose five deliverables to ensure the longevity and usability of linkable musicological data: (1) authoritative or "minted" URIs for composers that can confidently be used to align/link related sources, and links to those composers in scholarly data sources (2) persistence of this URI resource (3) a suite of tools to enable new sources to be easily aligned with these URIs (4) a Codex to host pointers to any other linked data sources using our URIs (5) exemplary visualization/exploration interactions to show how the data can be used for knowledge building.
    * **problem it solves for what end user?**: the research lecturer will no longer have to...???

    1. Codex
    1. Exposed Linked Data (via SPARQL endpoint)
